The pump is governed by an Arduino

The arduino is using a Relay shield that boosts 5V to 12V using source, and another relay that activates the contactor of the pump.

Using a HLK-PM01 to read AC To know whether pump is working
Using a resistance divider 12V to know whether manual mode is on

The system is connected via USB to the Gateway.
120Omh resistance used to avoid resets

Connection for remote update is done via Gateway

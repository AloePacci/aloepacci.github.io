This part is a bit tricky.

For this part, you will need the base station abd the Reach M+ module.

In case you have no access to the Base station, a good approach is to consider it has default values.

1. configure [base station](./GPS_base,html)
2. configure [Reach M+](./GPS_reach.html)

Once both are configured, we can proceed to check the correct configuration.

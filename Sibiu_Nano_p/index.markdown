Welcome to Sibiu Nano Plus project! 

This is a huge project that aims to create an autonomous "inexpensive" system for subsea autonomous or semiautonomous navigation able to measure data. Helping us monitorize sea environments parameters as well as gather data to analyze afterwards.

A first step to subsea environments, state of art was done in the work [Control, Model and simulation of a LUUV](./TFG), using [UUV Simulator](https://uuvsimulator.github.io/) to simulate the behaviour of the UUV.

A second step was done in the work [Design of the control system for autonomous navigation of a light underwater vehicle](./TFM.markdown), where the actual vehicle was used, its software modified, and some sensors added making test of automatic navigation.

Afterwards, the code was improved and an user interface created, making use of the vehicle to monitorize data from big masses of water [you can check it here](https://github.com/AloePacci/Sibiu_Nano_p)
